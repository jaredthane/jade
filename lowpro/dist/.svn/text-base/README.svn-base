Low Pro is a small JavaScript library built as an extension to Prototype that makes unobtrusive DOM scripting much easier.  Here's a rundown of the functionality:

* Prettier DOM Builder that wraps Prototype's new Element
* Event.onReady() - add callbacks that execute as soon as the DOM is ready (now delegates to prototypes built in support for backward compatibility).
* Event.addBehavior() - add behaviors to elements declaratively using CSS selectors.
* Behavior object binding - If you prefer a more OO approach to behaviors Behavior.create() will create a behavior class that you can bind to elements.

Compatible with Prototype 1.6
Tested in: Firefox 1.5 (PC/Mac), Safari 2, IE 6+, Opera 9 (PC/Mac)

This library is based on the work of many great JavaScript programmers:

Justin Palmer: event:Selectors which is the basis for addBehavior.
