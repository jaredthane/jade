http://www.hoboes.com/Mimsy/hacks/replicating-djangos-admin/



	figure out how to get an audit trail (see saved pages in howtos)
	figure out how to add pics :)
	get pagination working again
	make pdfs
	inventory models need unicodes
	learn about metaclasses
	HAVE to figure out how to set account names using account.name="Cash" and not name_es
	
	To test order form:
	delete
	add line
	new sale
	update line
	set price
	set warranty
	set tax
	set quantity
	set serials
	change site
	change date
	check accounting
	check inventory
	auto create orders for excess lines
	request receipt numbers for extra orders
	
	
	Serial Numbers:
		would be nice if it glowed for a second when it appears
		many to many so a line could have a many to many relationship to serial numbers
		when a new line is created a cooresponding serial number line should be created since qty = 1
		when user increases 
	
	Transactions and Movements same thing:
		Types of Movements:
			Sale
			Purchase
			Delivery
			Receive
			Payment
			Count
