Goals:
user allowed to set accounts if they want
	could be set later if we want, 
	but then you'ld have to delete unneeded accounts
if left to default, system should create accounts automaticly
account names should be like: "Turin - Expenses"
and should somehow be translated

Or I could just hard-link the Site to an account and let user rename the account
what if I allow null and do custom validation?


Decision:
Set null=True for now.
Try the following:
1. Add custom validation on the form and leave null=True on the db
2. Create a dummy account and a custom manager to hide it.
3. Hard link it.
